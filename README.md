# InnovNation_Hackathon

This code is an attempt at integrating multiple libraries in order to be able to read a whole handwritten page and turn it into an editable word document.

So far, the only things we've been able to accomplish in this prototype are:
1. Text extraction (w/ Spell checking to reduce chance of error)
2. Highlighted text extraction (Yellow & Green highlights)
3. Placing the highlighted & regular text in a word document

However, making a fully functional version is definitely feasible, given the time and the resources.

In order to run this prototype you will need these packages:<br/>
(easyocr, cv2, numpy, docx, docx.shared, spellchecker, docx.enum.text)

Kindly, begin by taking a look at the sample image. Then, take a look at the output.docx which is a document that extracts the text (with only one incorrect word) and highlights the text correctly.
However, the layout of the text is still a work under progress.

Thank you! ðŸŒ¸
